# Redactle helper

If you want to bulk guess a load of words in redactle without having to type them all out, I've put my most frequently guessed starter words in a list, and they'll be submitted automatically. To do this, open the browser console, copy the code in `redactle.js`, paste it into the console and hit enter. To add your own words to the list of guesses, add them in quotes to the `words` list that starts at the top of the file.

On my product roadmap for this is making it into a browser extension so it will run automatically when the page is loaded.
